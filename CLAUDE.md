## üìã REMAINING TECHNICAL DEBT

### UI Components (Non-Critical)
- [ ] `adapters/redux-browser.js` ‚Üí TypeScript (295 lines, DOM integration)
- [ ] `ui/renderer.js` ‚Üí TypeScript (578 lines, ASCII rendering)

*Both are well-isolated and don't block core functionality. Terminal mode works perfectly.*

**Note:** The current UI migration plan defines a portable, streaming-capable architecture (RenderTarget abstraction, StreamRenderer) compatible with a Redux backend that streams state to UIs. However, it should be updated to explicitly include:
- Integration with Redux backend streaming for all UIs (browser and terminal)
- Implementation of a blessed-based terminal UI as a RenderTarget
- Testing and validation of streaming for both browser and terminal (blessed) clients

**üìñ Detailed Migration Plan**: See [`TypeScript-UI-Migration-Plan.md`](TypeScript-UI-Migration-Plan.md) for comprehensive implementation guide with code examples and portable UI architecture.

**üìñ Game Server Architecture**: See [`GameServer-Redux-Middleware-Plan.md`](GameServer-Redux-Middleware-Plan.md) for Redux middleware implementation with Unreal Engine 5 and Unity integration.

- Comprehensive test suite (22/22 tests passing)
- Rich game content across 4+ genres

**Files Requiring Migration:**
1. `adapters/redux-browser.js` (295 lines) ‚Üí TypeScript with enhanced type safety
2. `ui/renderer.js` (578 lines) ‚Üí TypeScript with UnifiedRenderer interface

**Success Criteria:**

- Game Server middleware at `core/middleware/gameServerMiddleware.ts`
- Redux store integration via `core/store.ts` with WebSocket broadcasting

### 6. ECS Backend Architecture Consideration ‚úÖ (Aug 11, 2025)
- **Performance Analysis**: Current entity conversion creates performance bottlenecks at 30 FPS
- **Scalability Issues**: Fixed entity structure limits multi-genre game development
- **Multi-Platform Benefits**: ECS would enhance Unity DOTS and Unreal Engine integration
- **Implementation Strategy**: Hybrid approach recommended - ECS backend with Redux frontend bridge

**Recommended Hybrid Architecture - Redux Command Layer + ECS Backend:**
```typescript
// Redux remains the command/action layer
interface GameCommand {
  type: string;
  payload: any;
  entityId?: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

// ECS handles entity state and performance-critical updates
interface ECSBackend {
  world: World;                    // ECS World container
  systems: SystemManager;          // Update systems (Movement, Combat, Network)
  componentManager: ComponentStore; // Component data storage
}

// Bridge layer translates Redux actions ‚Üí ECS component updates
interface ReduxECSBridge {
  executeCommand(command: GameCommand): ComponentDelta[];
  syncStateToRedux(world: World): Partial<RootState>;
  handleMiddleware(action: PayloadAction<any>): void;
}

// Example: Redux action triggers ECS system update
const movePlayerMiddleware = (action: MovePlayerPayload) => {
  const entity = ecsWorld.getEntity('player');
  const position = entity.getComponent<PositionComponent>();
  position.x += action.direction === 'right' ? 1 : -1;
  
  // Redux state stays synchronized for UI
  return { type: 'player/updatePosition', payload: { x: position.x, y: position.y } };
};
```

**Why Keep Redux as Command Layer:**
- **Command Pattern**: Actions as immutable commands with full audit trail
- **Time Travel Debugging**: Redux DevTools for development and debugging
- **Middleware Pipeline**: Event system, game server broadcasting, logging
- **UI State Management**: React/UI components continue using familiar Redux patterns
- **Testing**: Actions remain easily testable and mockable
- **Undo/Redo**: Command history naturally supported
- **Deterministic Replays**: Action sequences can reproduce exact game states

**Hybrid Architecture Benefits:**

**Redux Layer (Commands & State):**
- **Developer Experience**: Familiar Redux patterns for UI and game logic
- **Debugging**: Full action history and time-travel debugging
- **Testability**: Actions and reducers easily unit testable
- **Middleware**: Event broadcasting, logging, game server integration
- **Determinism**: Reproducible game states from action sequences

**ECS Layer (Performance & Entities):**
- **Performance**: 60-80% network bandwidth reduction through component deltas
- **Cache Efficiency**: Component arrays for optimal memory layout
- **Parallel Processing**: Systems can run concurrently
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new behaviors without state tree changes

**Integration Strategy:**
```typescript
// Redux Action ‚Üí ECS System ‚Üí Redux State Update
dispatch(movePlayer({ direction: 'right' }))
  ‚Üì Redux Middleware
  ‚Üí ECS Movement System updates PositionComponent
  ‚Üì ECS Bridge
  ‚Üí Redux state synchronized for UI rendering
```

**Multi-Genre Engine Advantages:**
- **Command Consistency**: Same Redux actions work across RPG, gambling, business modes
- **ECS Flexibility**: Different component combinations per game mode
- **UI Simplicity**: React components continue using Redux selectors
- **Network Efficiency**: ECS broadcasts only changed components
- **Development Velocity**: Redux for rapid prototyping, ECS for optimization

**Implementation Priority**: Phase 4 (post-TypeScript migration) - maintains existing Redux benefits while adding ECS performance

- ‚úÖ **Scheduling Resolution**: Fixed precedence cycles with `@system(s => s.inAnyOrderWith())`
- ‚úÖ **API Compliance**: Following official Becsy documentation patterns exactly

**Critical API Corrections:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Queries as system properties
@system
class CommandSystem extends System {
  networkEntities = this.query(q => q.current.with(NetworkEntity).read);
  networkPosition = this.query(q => q.current.with(NetworkEntity).read.and.with(Position).write);
  
  findEntityById(id: string) {
    for (const entity of this.networkEntities.current) {
      const networkComp = entity.read(NetworkEntity);
      if (networkComp.entityId === id) return entity;
    }
    return null;
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Correct: System access via attach pattern
@system
class SystemManager extends System {
  private commandSystem = this.attach(CommandSystem);
  private projectionSystem = this.attach(ProjectionSystem);
}
```
